## Enable GitHub Pages

1. **Go to your repository settings**:

   - Wait for it to complete (usually 2-3 minutes)

   - Once deployed, visit: https://ahidayatxx.github.io/ai-use-case-canvas/

## Workflow Details

The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) automatically:
- Builds the application on every push to `main`
- Optimizes assets for production
- Deploys to GitHub Pages

## Troubleshooting

### Workflow fails
- Check the Actions tab for error logs
- Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings

### Site not loading
- Verify the workflow completed successfully
- Check that the base path is correct in `vite.config.ts`
- Clear browser cache and try again

### 404 errors
- Ensure GitHub Pages source is set to "GitHub Actions"
- Check that the `base` path in `vite.config.ts` matches your repository name

## Update the Application

1. Make your changes locally
2. Commit and push to main:
   ```bash
   git add .
